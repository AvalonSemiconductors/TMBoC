Overview
========

This repo contains a collection of a whole bunch of projects, each of which is too small individually to warrant an independent submission. Instead, all are combined into a single die.

     - Design I/O

AD0 - AD3 select which of the designs on the die is active. The active design will be given direct access to IO11 - IO37. The pinout of those I/Os thus depends on the selected design. There is a independent clock and reset input for the selected design, though a given design may use the system clock instead of the independent clock.


Projects from TT2 
=================

All projects in this category were originally TinyTapeout 2 submissions, before I included them here, though some have been upgraded slightly to make use of the additional space and I/O.

------------
4x4 Multiply
------------

`Original Project <https://github.com/AvalonSemiconductors/tt2-4x4-multiply/>`_

Multiplies two 4-bit numbers and gives the result. Implemented using purely combinatorial logic.

.. list-table:: Pinout
   :name: pinout
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   
   * - Pin
     - Name
   * - IO11
     - A0
   * - IO12
     - A1
   * - IO13
     - A2
   * - IO14
     - A3
   * - IO15
     - B0
   * - IO16
     - B1
   * - IO17
     - B2
   * - IO18
     - B3
   * - IO19
     - R0
   * - IO20
     - R1
   * - IO21
     - R2
   * - IO22
     - R3
   * - IO23
     - R4
   * - IO24
     - R5
   * - IO25
     - R6
   * - IO26
     - R7

The two 4-bit inputs are provided on A0-3 and B0-3, and the 8-bit result appears on R0-7.

     - JMP

Notable changes from the original design is the simplified bus interface. The instruction inputs (I0 - I3) are now decoupled from the data bus (DB0 - DB3), which is now bi-directional instead of having separate inputs and outputs. The 8-bit data byte emitted by the CPU on the second clock phase is now also buffered internally, and output separately (MD0 - MD7). The MAR can be loaded directly from these outputs, and the PC from MD0 - 7 and DB0 - DB3.

The design now also aids the control logic by outputting a one-hot vector indicating the current clock phase (PHI0 - PHI3).

--------
Diceroll
--------

`Original Project <https://github.com/AvalonSemiconductors/tt2-diceroll/>`_

.. list-table:: Pinout
   :name: pinout
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   
   * - Pin
     - Name
   * - IO11
     - ROLL
   * - IO12
     - Segment A
   * - IO13
     - Segment B
   * - IO14
     - Segment C
   * - IO15
     - Segment D
   * - IO16
     - Segment E
   * - IO17
     - Segment F
   * - IO18
     - Segment G
   * - IO19
     - Decimal point

The only change to the original is that the value of a counter is now added to the LFSR RNG, to reduce the probability of the same number appearing twice and making the animation appear to "freeze" for a moment.

LCD Namebadge
-------------

`Original Project <https://github.com/AvalonSemiconductors/tt2-lcd-namebadge/>`_
